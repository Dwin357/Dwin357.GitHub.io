### Dwin - After Dark
##### an informal interview by an anonymous questioner with the person known as Dwin 

**__Q: Thank you for agreeing to speak with us__**
D: Oh it is no problem really.  You know how it is when you are "activly seeking opportunities", you have to make yourself avaliable to the world.

**__Q: I take it by your answer this is not something you enjoy?__**
D: I wouldn't go quite that far.  I'm a shy-extrovert, I draw my energy from other people, so on some level I enjoy getting out and meeting all the new people.  The catch is that shy part.  When I am working with people on a common problem there is a defined/known relationship between us that I find reassuring.  I find the same with boardgames in a social setting.  The trouble I have with job-hunting is how chaotic it is, like going to bed at night with no assurance that the sun will rise tomorrow or that a rouge-astroid won't wipe me out during the night.

**__Q: I see.  Does that mean you dislike change?__**
