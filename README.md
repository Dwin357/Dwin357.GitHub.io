#### Technical Skills
 - Stand up green-field ruby applications in a classic rails or trailblazer pattern
 - Extend / modify behavior of existing micro-services applications in well tested / safe ways
 - Refactor existing applications into trailblazer pattern (adds abstraction layers to M+C and/or V)
 - Extend / modify behavior of rack based applications / gems
 - Add asynchronus background behavior to existing application (Sidekiq)
 - Add asynchronus front-end behavior to existing application (Backbone and/or jQuery)
 - Refactor / build application to take advantage of redis
 
#### Cultural Skills
 - Listen to + Confirm + Communicate the vision/intent of a product-owner for a project (PO need > developer want)
 - Transparently communicate project status + challenges to non-technical product-owners (demystify process)
 - Solicite buy-in / participation of other developers on team (counter-force to development-silos)
 - Provide feedback which includes both premises and conclusions (depersonalizes and gives rational footing to the feedback)

#### Experience
###### Apprenticeship Cover My Meds
*Principally worked on a green field project to allow seamless user-sessions throughout a micro-services eco-system by using JWTs.*

**JWT-SSO**
 Technologies: JsonWebTokens, JsonWebKeys, RSA keys, Trailblazer-rails, Rack, Sidekiq, Redis, Ldap
 - built a central application in a trailblazer pattern which was responsible for generating and managing JWT's which would be set in users's sessions.
 - worked on a companion gem which used rack-middleware to provide shared session behavior for client-applications auto-magically.

**Other Projects**
  Technologies: Sidekiq, MVC-rails
 - wrote a periodic sidekiq worker that deletes sensitive information which meets defined business criteria
 - added a patch to existing applications which passed stubbed user-credentials on a test-server, allowing marketing to easily perform focus-group work in a production-like environment.
 
###### Before Coding
**IL-ARNG**
 - Specialist and team-leader.  Drove trucks in close support of infantry units.
**ComPsych**
 - Determined probable liability of FMLA claims and administered qualifying absences for clients.  
 - Communicated with HR about how regulations applied to the client's specific situations and what risks were associated with different courses of action.  
 - Communicated with employees their entitlements and status.

#### Icebreakers
 - I like boardgames and dancing, as both provide an explicite context to interact with people (I'm shy by default)
 - I play Dungeons and Dragons on a weekly basis, as a way of exploring who I would be if I were someone else
 - I always found strong parallels between programs and orgainzations.  In one information flows through the system producing behavior, while in the other resources flow through producing value --but in both cases the same patterns can be picked out.
