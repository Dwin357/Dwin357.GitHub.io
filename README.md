### Dwin - After Dark
##### an informal interview by an anonymous questioner with the person known as Dwin 

**__Q: Thank you for agreeing to speak with us __**
Oh it is no problem really.  You know how it is when you are "actively seeking opportunities", you have to make yourself available to the world.

**__Q: I take it by your answer job hunting is not something you enjoy? __**
I wouldn't go quite that far.  I'm a shy-extrovert, I draw my energy from other people, so on some level I enjoy getting out and meeting all the new people.  The catch is that shy part.  When I am working with people on a common problem there is a defined/known relationship between us that I find reassuring.  I find the same with boardgames in a social setting.  The trouble I have with job-hunting is how chaotic it is, like going to bed at night with no assurance that the sun will rise tomorrow or that a rouge-asteroid won't wipe me out during the night.

**__Q: Does that mean you dislike change? __**
Quite the opposite actually, I am a huge fan of change.  What I struggle with is randomness.  The way I see it there is an inherent **contextualness** to all **things**, and the world is just the build up of compromises between objects and contexts.  A consequence of this perspective is that you can effect change just by shifting context.  The ability to make something different just by shifting the lighting on it and never touching the object itself.  As a child my mind was blown, what cooler thing is there than action-from-a-distance.  Of course the specific incarnation changed over time: when I was seven, the perfect embodiment of this principal was stage-magic; when I was twenty-one it was psychology; now it is technology.  At every stage though [performance -> individual-perception -> collective- organization & communication] I refined my methodology of shifting context to produce change so that now it is integral to my ability to navigate the world as is my sense of sight or sound.  Now the thing about randomness is that it is the antithesis of context; it is as darkness to light.  Do sighted-people dislike moving around, probably not.  If you drop a sighted-person into a unknown pitch black room are they going to start running around, no --but it is unrelated to their feelings toward movement.

**__Q: Wow; that, is a lot to take in __**
Ya, I'm sorry, that is one of the drawbacks of my methodology.  If I don't have certain concepts cached with the other person I tend to put a load on them when setting up my assumptions.  It actually tends to make people yawn and feel sleepy (or disengage), currently an unsolved problem for me.

**__Q: Sure, I guess, but if this is something you have known about you must have some strategy for dealing with it? __**


**__Q: So 'Dwin', your given name is Edwin, any particular reason behind dropping the 'E'? __**
It was a symbolic decision actually.  I figure, a name is the reduction of a person to a word, and an initial is the reduction of a name to a character... so what if my moniker  was what was left of my name after this reduction had run its course.  A gesture of allegiance to the anti-thesis of today's prevailing reductionist winds.  It is purely symbolic of course, but I take my victories where I can find them.

**__Q: And the '357' that normally follows, any significance there? __**
Ya, that is my optimism poking out.  Intended as [3, 5, 7...], as in a sequence of ascending prime numbers; it is an assertion that in the course of development humans will inevitably discover irreducible ideas which will force the expansion of our perceptions despite all of the reductionist head-winds which might be encountered along the way.  Basically a "long-arc-of-the-moral-universe" argument against the reductionist point of view.

**__Q: You seem to be taking a very strong position on "reductionism", going so far as to set up an allusion to segregation and racism.  That seems a bit over blown __**
Well yes.  Keep in mind the last two questions were specifically about my moniker, which was selected when I was younger and is perhaps more hyperbolic than one I would create now.  That said, I feel I had a legitimate grievance back then which are still relevant today.  There is a natural link between the language people use to talk around something and the analysis they use to interpret it.  So, to the extent that network effects force an individual to communicate in the lowest-common-denominator, this has a deleterious effect on the individual's private ability to analyze what is going on.  As someone who's private thought patterns may be more different, I might notice this more, but it is never the less an externality that runs counter to enlightenment-ideals and which all people suffer under to some extent.

**__Q: You have expressed a couple of different ideas, how does your philosophy relate to technology? __**
Sure.  Thank you for asking, this is a question I love to answer.  Calling back to what I mentioned before about **contextualness**, for me this question is at the cutting edge of my understanding of how outcomes can be shaped by context.  Without diving too deeply down the rabbit-hole, my logic flows: 
collaboration is powerful because of an ability to leverage the effort from multiple individuals; 
  the potential for collaboration to scale is directly limited by the ability of individuals to accurately and effectivly communicate with each other;  
    within communication, the biggest risk comes from the misalignment of definitions (ie: in conversation you propose 'X', I agree with 'X', and in practice we find we had totally different ideas of what was meant by 'X') 




the current frontier of my understanding is sorting out how groups and individuals leverage each other for mutual benefit.  On the one level, 

**__Q: We only have time for one more question, so why don't we leave on, "If you could have any job what would it be?" __**
Ha ha, back to that "actively seeking opportunities" aspect.  The perfect role for me is one where I am asked to solve / answer business questions which cut accross multiple domains.
